    <h2>OBJECTIVE</h2>
    <p class="pgContent" id="objectivesPg">
      Solid experience in management of technical assistance for filmmaking. Great interest in business analysis.<br>
      I am seeking for a challenging job in management of the sphere of technical assistance for film- and video production and related areas.<br>
      Being a beginner in Python programming with high ambitions to promote in this field (with application of knowledge and skills in the field of data analysis), 
      I see any improvement being possible only with taking high bars set by yourself.<br>
      I have significant experience in management of material resources and considerable competency in HR-management in a highly competitive market of film and video production, 
      where consumer (client) traditionally "calls the shots". Ready to relocate to another country.
